# The Dreams That Changed Me  
*A journey not just of hijab — but of divine direction.*

I wasn't a hijabi growing up.  
Yes, I wore the burqa.  
But not the hijab the way it should be worn —  
not with the intention, not with the heart.  

I thought I had time.  
I thought covering sometimes was enough.  
Until one night,  
I had a dream.  
But not just any dream —  
**A dream that shook my soul.**  

I saw him.  
**Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.**  

I was standing at the main door of my house.  
My dupatta rested carelessly on my shoulders.  
And I *knew* he was outside.  
A man in white.  
Not just any man.  
**Him.**  

I wanted to run out.  
I wanted to greet him.  
But I couldn’t move.  
Because I *knew* —  
My head was bare.  
And that was no way  
To face **the beloved of Allah.**

I froze.  
In shame.  
In longing.  
In awe.  

When I woke up,  
I told my mother.  
She didn’t hesitate.  
She said:  

> **"This is your sign.  
> Start your hijab.  
> Not just with cloth —  
> But with conviction."**

That’s how it began.  
Not with fashion.  
Not with fear.  
But with **faith**.

The second dream came  
After the death of my daughter.  
I still remember it.  
*Clear. Gentle. Heavy.* 

This time, in the dream
I was walking through a garden with my sister.  
Nothing.  
Just peace.

Until we reached a guarded room.  
The guard stopped her - my sister 
But allowed me in.  

And suddenly —  
I had a baby in my arms.  
Just like that.  
As if **motherhood had become my key.**

Inside the room,  
He was there again.  
**Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.**  
And beside him,  
**Bibi Ayesha R.A.**  

No words.  
No noise.  
Just presence.  
Just love.  

The third time —  
A dream again.  
But blurry.  
I was disturbed, in pain.  
I don’t remember it well.  
Only that it was him.  
And I saw him.  
**Again.**  

---

These weren’t stories.  
These weren’t metaphors.  
They were **dreams sent to wake me up**.  
To realign me.  
To remind me.  
That even when I drift —  
**Allah Ta’ala brings me back.**  

This journey —  
was never about cloth.  
It was about **clarity**.  
About letting go of who I thought I had to be,  
and stepping into who I was created to become.

I was not always strong.  
But He made me firm.  
Through trials.  
Through heartbreak.  
Through the days when I wanted to give up.

He never left.  
Not even for a moment.  

Allah Ta’ala held my soul when it was tired,  
and my feet when they couldn’t move.  
He arranged everything.  
**Meticulously.**

And now,  
I don’t walk with fear.  
I walk with **purpose**.  
With my head covered.  
And my heart open.  

Because I know —  
I don’t need to be perfect.  
Just sincere.  

And I know,  
He found me  
**Even when I wasn’t looking.**
