#Why Businesses Fail Due to Invisible Costs

##The Hidden Costs Behind Justt & Byju’s Fall

###An exploration of what’s gained, what’s lost, and what rarely gets talked about.

####Introduction: Why I Wrote This

In the span of three years, I went from a scholarship-winning student at Byju’s to a branch manager inside the very edtech world I once admired. Even earlier, I had worked at Justt - a startup that seemed full of promise: talented people, well-funded, and equipped with the right tools.
But things didn’t fall apart because of one wrong decision. They unraveled because of a hundred small ones.
I wasn’t just using the product anymore I was inside the machine. And what I witnessed wasn’t a lack of effort, but a quiet erosion: confusion, miscommunication, burnout, and misalignment. It wasn’t until much later that I found the right language for what I had seen: invisible costs.
Now, as someone learning digital marketing, I’ve come to understand that metrics like CAC, LTV, and funnel drop-offs tell only part of the story. They show symptoms, not causes. The deeper issues, the misalignments between people, tools, and strategy are what silently break businesses. That’s the gap no dashboard can track.
I’m not writing this to impress with jargon. I’m writing to understand how something that looked so full of potential, backed by funding, filled with talent, and armed with the best tools could still fall apart.
I’ve lived through this. Now I’m trying to make sense of it, using the lens of digital marketing and business strategy.
This report is more than a case study. It’s part reflection, part analysis, part storytelling. It explores two very different companies Justt and Byju’s connected by a single theme:
**how businesses quietly bleed from costs no spreadsheet ever shows**.

####Invisible Costs – In My Words
These aren’t costs you’ll find in a P&L statement or listed on a balance sheet. They’re the costs of confusion, silence, ego, unused tools, and unclear roles, costs that don’t show up until it’s too late.
It’s the cost of everyone waiting for a decision that never comes.
→The cost of tools bought to look “modern” but never adopted.
→The cost of high turnover when no one feels seen or heard.
→The cost of marketing ideas thrown around but never tracked or tested.
Invisible costs are subtle—but lethal.

“Most Indian startups fail not because they lacked tech  but because they mistook movement for momentum.”
— Kunal Shah, Founder of CRED (interview, 2021)

###Part One: When Startups Run Without Maps - Justt
A Case of Invisible Costs

####Start With a Scene

The CEO, an IIM Ahmedabad graduate, paces the floor. Three projects are launched in one week. Slack buzzes. Interns stare at Jira/Trello boards, unsure of what they’re doing.
We have dashboards, CRMs, tools but no one knows what to track.

####The Triple-Project Chaos

At Justt, I watched three disconnected product lines launch simultaneously. One team was split across all three. No roadmap, no priorities, no ownership.
We were in constant motion, but going nowhere.

This wasn’t scaling, it was sprinting into a wall.

####Invisible Cost in Action: No Strategy, Tools ≠ Clarity

Slack, JIRA, Trello, HubSpot, Freshdesk, Zoom - we had everything. But no one taught us how to use them. Interns were expected to build funnels and run paid ads. 
No brief. No personas. No A/B testing. Our CRM was bloated with inactive leads. Our dashboards were full of vanity metrics.

####Leadership Vacuum

The CEO dismissed ideas he didn’t like. Appreciation was rare. Meetings were long and agenda-less. People stopped speaking up. 
The cost wasn’t in dollars - it was in disengagement.

####The Emotional Cost: Silence Over Strategy

At the time, I didn’t know what to call it. Now I do: invisible costs. The price of silence. The cost of pretending everything's fine.
Burnout disguised as hustle.
Marketing done without a plan.

Strategy replaced by improvisation.

#### Real Data That Now Makes Sense

**Zinnov(2023)**: 40% of Indian SaaS startups suffer from tool redundancy and confusion.
**Microsoft India (2022)**: Employees lose up to 8 hours a week in unproductive meetings.
**Gartner (2023)**: 30% of software subscriptions go underutilized or completely wasted.

####What I Learned

From Justt, I learned that digital marketing without clarity is just noise in motion. Tools can’t fix broken thinking. Funnels don’t matter when the team is lost.

No amount of ad budget can rescue a product that no one truly owns or understands.
But the deeper lesson was this: the real damage comes from what doesn’t get discussed.
Invisible costs weren’t just abstract concepts, they left a mark.
The price of poor planning wasn’t just missed deadlines it was exhausted people doing guesswork.

The cost of silence wasn’t just awkward meetings, it was talent tuning out.
The tools we used didn’t fail us.
We failed to align around them.
Justt didn’t collapse.

***It leaked - slowly, quietly, and constantly.***

###Part Two: When Scale Becomes the Strategy -  Byjus 
 ####The Fall of a Giant, Seen From the Inside

 ####How It Began
 
Byju’s was larger than life. Big promises, big ads with Shahrukh khan, big growth.
When I scored 92% in their scholarship test, I believed in their mission.Free mentorship, free content, I felt lucky. 

Then, in 2023, I joined the edtech world as a branch manager. And slowly, the cracks in the system started to show.

####Acquisition Without Integration

Byju’s acquired over 10 firms - Osmo, Aakash, WhiteHat Jr., Toppr—but each had different systems, teams, cultures, and audiences.
There was no clear marketing alignment.
The result?

Brand confusion. Audience fatigue. Massive ad spends without returns.

####Sales First, Strategy Later

Byju’s engine ran on aggressive sales, not long-term journeys.
Pressure tactics often replaced personalization—not in isolated cases, but as part of the larger structure.
From what I observed, everything leaned toward quick conversions.
Lead meetings, onboarding calls, and customer interactions seemed designed more for immediate closure than for nurturing trust or long-term engagement.
Conversion was everything.

Retention? Often treated as an afterthought.

####Overstacked With Underuse

Byju’s poured money into tools - Salesforce, analytics dashboards, CRMs but teams weren’t aligned or trained.
Just like at Justt, tools created the **illusion of structure**.
But behind the scenes, data was messy, unclear, or unused.

####Burnout Behind the Numbers

By 2023, - 
layoffs crossed 3,500+.
Teams shrunk.
Marketing projects were paused mid-way. 
Customer queries slowed down.
Morale dropped.
From the outside, it looked like scaling.
From the inside, it was like **freefall**.

####Data That Hit Hard

₹6,000+ crore loss in FY22 (Business Today, 2023)
3,500+ layoffs in 2023 (Economic Times)
Decline in app downloads after WhiteHat Jr. merger (Entrackr)
59% of Indian SMEs underutilize CRMs (Salesforce India, 2022)

####What I Learned

Byju’s wasn’t just a startup it was a phenomenon.
It reshaped how millions of Indian students learned.
It inspired thousands to pursue dreams they didn’t think possible.
But even giants can stumble and often, not because of what’s visible.

At Byju’s, I saw how invisible costs quietly grew behind the scenes:
Tools were plenty, but adoption was uneven.
Acquisitions were many, but integration was lacking.
Teams were large, but roles were unclear.
Campaigns ran on repeat, but insights rarely looped back.
The real cost wasn’t financial, it was **operational**.

A CRM unused is one thing.
But a demoralized team, a confused customer, and a disengaged learner?
That’s where the damage deepens.

####The Spiral of Invisible Costs

**Invisible Costs → Miscommunication → Low Productivity → Delayed Decisions → Burnout → Failure**

####What I Didn’t Include — And Why It Matters

I considered going deep into financial jargon—ROCE, EBITDA margins, valuation models, even quoting HBS frameworks. It sounded impressive... but felt hollow.
I’m not a finance expert.
I’m a digital marketing learner trying to make sense of a messy, real-world collapse I saw up close.
I could’ve calculated growth projections.

But that wouldn’t explain the chaos of aimless meetings, overlapping tools, or the silence when no one knew who was in charge.
So instead of crunching numbers, I zoomed in—on the human systems, the digital noise, and the slow drip of poor decisions that silently broke something that once looked unstoppable.
What I excluded isn’t a gap, it's a choice.


####Final Thought: What These Numbers Don’t Show - But Should

Numbers help us spot patterns.
But they don’t show the silences in meetings.
They don’t capture blank stares from interns who don’t know what they’re building.
Or the quiet stress of a team that’s working without direction.
Invisible costs aren’t just inefficiencies - they’re signals.
Signals of confusion, misalignment, and poor leadership.
I didn’t just read about them.
I felt them.

The irony?
Both companies had the resources to succeed - but lacked the clarity to use them well.

So while this section tried to analyze what went wrong on paper, the bigger story is still human:

→Tools without intent.
→ Teams without purpose.
→ Movement without momentum.

Maybe that’s where digital marketing can actually help - not as a hack, but as a **lens to ask better questions:**
Who are we building for?
What are we measuring?
Are we aligned—or just busy being busy?

Startups are told to move fast and break things.
But maybe the real wisdom is:
**Move clearly - and notice the cracks before they collapse.**
